\section{Testing Cable Phase Stability}
We connect a SMA cable between port 1 and 2. 

Before connecting the cable, the SMA connector's pin depth and dielectric depth are both checked and are within spec. Also, the SMA connector was examined under a stereo microscope and it was cleaned with a cotton swab and alcohol to remove surface contaminants (specks of dirt and metal fragments).

When plotting $S_{11}$, we see reflections and re-reflections 20 dB down which reflect both imperfections in the cable's impedance and possible factory calibration issues in the VNA. When measuring $S_{21}$, we see that almost all the delivered power from port 1 makes its way to port 2 and we only see some drop-off at high frequencies, where the VNA itself might be out-of-cal.
