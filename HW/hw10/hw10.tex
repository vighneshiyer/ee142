\section{Mixer Analysis}
\begin{figure}[H]

\end{figure}

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item {\color{blue} For the FET mixer shown above with the FET parameters annotated, estimate (calculate) the mixer down-conversion power gain for an input RF signal at 2.1 GHz and LO at 2 GHz. Verify your estimation by ADS simulation.}

    We do the hand-calculations assuming a long-channel device.

    \begin{align*}
        I_d &= \frac{1}{2} K_p \frac{W}{L} (V_{gs} - V_{th})^2 \\
        &= 5 \text{ mA} \\
        g_m &= \frac{2 I_d}{V_{ov}} = 0.036 \\
        G_m &= Q \cdot g_m = 2.002 \cdot g_m = 0.072 \\
        I_{tail} &= I_d + v_s \cos(\omega_{RF} t) \cdot G_m \\
        &= 5 \text{ mA} + v_s \cos(\omega_{RF} t) \cdot 0.076 \\
        K &= \frac{1}{2} K_p \frac{W}{L} \\
        i_{d,1,2,diffpair} &\approx \frac{I_{tail}}{2} \pm \sqrt{2 K I_{tail}} \frac{v_{id}}{2} \text{ from disc slides} \\
        &= \frac{I_{tail}}{2} + \sqrt{2 K I_{dc}} (1 + \frac{I_{ac}}{2 I_{dc}}) \frac{v_{id}}{2} \\
        i_{IF} &= \sqrt{2 K I_{dc}} v_s \frac{G_m}{2 I_{dc}} \frac{0.2}{4} = 0.007 v_s \\
        v_{IF} &= 200 \cdot i_{IF} = 1.414 v_s
    \end{align*}

    The voltage conversion gain is 1.414.

    The ADS schematic:
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{problem1ab_schematic.pdf}
    \end{figure}

    Simulation results:
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{problem1ab_sim_results.pdf}
    \end{figure}

    \item {\color{blue} Calculate the LO and RF leakages at the IF port. Verify your results by ADS simulation.}

    The RF-to-IF leakage is caused by the Q-boosted transconductance of the tail FET which flows through the IF FET.
    \begin{align*}
        v_{out,RF} = v_s G_m \frac{1}{2} \cdot 200 = 7.17 v_s
    \end{align*}

    The LO-to-IF leakage is caused by the differential swing on the IF FET.
    \begin{align*}
        v_{out,LO} = \sqrt{2 K I_{dc}} \frac{v_{id}}{2} \cdot R_L = 0.395 \text{ V}
    \end{align*}

    The simulation results closely match the hand calculation.

    \item {\color{blue} Simulate the mixer IIP3.}
    The ADS schematic:
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{problem1c_schematic.pdf}
    \end{figure}

    Simulation results:
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{problem1c_sim_results.pdf}
    \end{figure}

    We find that the extrapolated lines intersect at -4.69 dBV.

    \item {\color{blue} Estimate the mixer IIP3 by hand calculation.}
    Unfortunately, I don't have time to look into this part.

    \item {\color{blue} Repeat part (a) to part (c) with the LO drive enhanced to 0.8$V_{pp}$.}

    Going through the same calculations, the voltage conversion gain would be 2.83, the RF leakage would be identical at 7.17 $v_s$ and the LO leakage would be 0.79 V (doubled from part b).
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{problem1e_gains.pdf}
    \end{figure}

    The simulation results match the calculations. The mixer IIP3 simulation results:
    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{problem1e_iip3.pdf}
    \end{figure}

    The extrapolated IIP3 is 11.63 dBV. This seems off though, since I would expect the new IIP3 to be lower with higher LO drive.

    \item {\color{blue} Roughly estimate the mixer SSB NF. The noise of the FETs and the noise of the load resistance can be excluded. Use an LO drive of 0.4$V_{pp}$.}

    The noise would only be caused by the source resistance.
    \begin{align*}
        v_{noise,o} = \sqrt{4 K T \cdot 50} \cdot 1.414 = 1.28 \text{ nV}
    \end{align*}

    I got 2.086 nV of noise at 100 Mhz from the harmonic balance noise simulation. This is higher than expected due to the additional noise mixed down by the LO, in addition to the voltage conversion gain at RF-LO.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Power Amplifier (PA) Output Waveform and Efficiency}
{\color{blue} Assume your FET transistor device has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maximum drain current of $I_{d,max}$
    \item Maximum drain voltage of $V_{d,max}$
    \item Minimum drain voltage of $V_{d,min}$
    \item If $V_g > 0.5$ then $I_d = (V_g - 0.5)$ else $I_d = 0$
    \item Input impedance of $50 \Omega$
\end{itemize}}
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item {\color{blue} Design the transistor drain bias voltage, gate bias voltage, drain bias current, and load impedance (including the load impedance at harmonics of the operation frequency) for Class-A and Class-B power amplifier operations.}

    Assume we are driving a load impedance of $1 \Omega$.

    For the Class A amplifier, set the drain bias voltage to $V_{d,max} / 2$ via an RF choke. Set the gate bias voltage to $0.5 + v_{in,pk-pk}/2$, set the load impedance to just the real load of $1 \Omega$, and let the drain bias current fall-out of the gate bias voltage.

    For the Class B amplifier, set the drain bias voltage to $V_{d,max} / 2$, gate bias voltage to $0.5 V$ with AC coupled input, and the load impedance to $1 \Omega$ || an LC tank that resonates at the operation frequency. The drain bias current is zero.

    \item {\color{blue} What are the power gains of the two designs?}

    For Class A, the peak output power is $(V_{d,max} - V_{d,min}) \cdot I_{d,max} / 8$. The input power is $P_{in} = \frac{v_{in}^2}{100 \cdot \sqrt{2}}$. The power gain is output power over input power and depends on the input signal amplitude.
    The power gain of the Class B amplifier is the same.

    \item {\color{blue} Following part(a), draw the time-domain transistor voltage and current waveforms at the peak output for the two designs.}

    I recreated a schematic for each amplifier based on the discussion slides, but wasn't able to produce a reasonable time-domain waveform for the Class B amplifier.
    Here are the class A and B current and voltage waveforms.

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{problem2c.pdf}
    \end{figure}

    \item {\color{blue} Following part(a), draw the power delivered to the load, dc power consumption, and the drain efficiency for your Class-A and Class-B designs. The x-axis in your plots should be the input power back-off from the input level corresponding to the maximum output power.}

    \begin{figure}[H]
        \centering \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{problem2d.pdf}
    \end{figure}

    These waveforms look generally correct and they were derived by sweeping $f$ where the input voltage amplitude was $0.5 / f$.

    \item {\color{blue} Following part(a), what are the peak power-added efficiencies (PAE) of your Class-A and Class-B PA designs?}

    For a Class A:
    \begin{align*}
        PAE = \frac{P_L - P_{in}}{P_{dc}} = \frac{V_{d,max} - V_{d,min} \cdot I_{d,max}/8 - v_{in}^2 / (100 \cdot \sqrt{2})}{v_{in}/2}
    \end{align*}

    For an ideal Class B, since the DC power is 0, the PAE would appear to be infinite.
\end{enumerate}
