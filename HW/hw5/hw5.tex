\section*{Problem 1}
{\color{blue}Find $y$ for the following normalized impedance on Smith Chart.}

The straightforward procedure is to plot $z_L$ on the impedance Smith Chart, and then look at what constant admittance and constant suspectance curves cross over the point in the admittance smith chart.

But, we can also plot $z_L$ on the impedance smith chart, then rotate the point by $\pi$ degrees along the constant SWR circle, and then read off the admittance by looking at the constant resistance and reactance curves.

I'm going to use the second technique; annotated charts aren't included in this document, but I'll compare the chart result I get to the exact calculation.
\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
    \item $z_L = 1.4 + 2j$
    \begin{align*}
        y_L = \frac{1}{z_L} = \frac{1}{\alpha + \beta j} = \frac{\alpha - \beta j}{\alpha^2 + \beta^2} &= 0.234899 -0.33557 j \\
        y_{L,chart} &= 0.22 - 0.32j
    \end{align*}

    \item $z_L = 0.5 + 0.9j$
    \begin{align*}
        y_L &= 0.471698 - 0.849 j \\
        y_{L,chart} &= 0.45 - 0.85j
    \end{align*}

    \item $z_L = 1.6 - 0.3j$
    \begin{align*}
        y_L &= 
    \end{align*}
\end{enumerate}

\end{document}
